# Welcome!
This is the second Mimmit Koodaa workshop about data structures and algorithms. We noticed that in the previous workshop it was slightly challenging to assess the experience of our lovely mimmit and this time we wanted to come with more granular information to allow everyone to learn something.

## Part 1 - Familiarize with JavaScript
If you are not sure about JavaScript syntax or if you have never coded before, we would really appreciate if you could spend the time to familiarize with the language, as it will make your understanding of algorithms easier.

## Part 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures
This is, for the most, the material we had throughout the first workshop. If you are familiar with JavaScript and you want to warm up for the advanced part of the workshop, please come here! 

## Part 3 - Pathfinding
[The pathfinding algorithm code of our awesome Tero](http://bit.ly/mk-pathfinding) can be found on this other istance of CodeSandbox. [Tero has also made some steps](https://codesandbox.io/s/mk-extras-77grm) that can guide you to work with the previous CodeSandbox and be more hands-on with advanced algorithms for graphs.
